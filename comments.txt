<The error you're encountering, specifically the 404 (Not Found) response for /api/auth/providers and the [next-auth][error][CLIENT_FETCH_ERROR], suggests there might be an issue with the setup or availability of your NextAuth API routes or the way your application is deployed. Here are some steps to diagnose and potentially resolve the issue:

Check the API Route
Confirm API Route File Location: Ensure that your [...nextauth].js file is placed in the correct directory. It should be inside pages/api/auth/. This is crucial because Next.js uses a file-based routing system, and if the file is not in the correct location, the route won't be recognized.
Inspect the File Name: Double-check the file name for typos. The file should be named [...nextauth].js. The three dots ... are important as they indicate a catch-all API route in Next.js.
Verify Deployment Configuration
Base Path Configuration: If your application is deployed with a base path (i.e., it's not served from the root of the domain), you need to configure NextAuth to be aware of this base path. This can be done by setting the NEXTAUTH_URL environment variable to the full base path where your application is served from.
Environment Variables: Ensure that all necessary environment variables (CLIENTID, OKTASECRECRET, YOUROKTADOMAIN) are properly set in the deployment environment. These are required for NextAuth to correctly configure the Okta provider.
Debugging Steps
Local Development: Test the application locally to see if the issue persists. If it works locally but not in production, the issue might be related to the deployment configuration.
Check Network Requests: Use your browser's developer tools to examine network requests when you click the sign-in button. Look specifically for requests to /api/auth/providers and see if there are any discrepancies in the request URL.
Review Application Logs: If your deployment service provides logs (like Vercel or Heroku), check them for any runtime errors or warnings that might indicate what's going wrong.
Review the Application URL: Ensure that the application URL in the browser matches the expected URL, including the correct protocol (http vs https), domain, and port if applicable.>
